SBMF (Slightly Beyond Mean Field):
	[ ] Unify memory allocation.
	[ ] Many-body pertrubation theory
			[ ] How is this different from regular P.T.?
			[ ] Do I need numerical integration?
	[ ] Potential speedup for ITEM, adaptive timestep
			[ ] See papers/item.pdf
		[ ] particle in a box, maybe rounded corners?
	[ ] interest is high in radial and toroidal geometry
	[ ] Is there a more efficient LAPACKE routine for complex band matrices?
	[ ] Which ARPACK routines should we use for complex band matrices?
	[ ] Basis functions instead of fdm
			[x] Quadgk for numerical integration
					[x] implement own quadrature?
							[ ] is it possible to find a table of eval points online?
					[ ] Use QUADPACK?

	[x] Convert column to row major in eigenvalue solver
	[x] numerical weirdness in results after a certain point?
			[x] whats going on?
				"	the output from lacpake isnt automatically converted to row major in the same way that
					the input is, changed interpretation of eigenvector output to column major. "
			[x] absolute values are still accurate.
				" turns out they weren't accurate, just sneaky, errors in this where especially visible at
					lower grid resolutions. "
	[x] the operator that we're diagonalizing should maybe be real?
		" it should not, we need the output eigenvectors to be complex. "
	[x] Try projecting full numerical hamiltonian onto known ground states (e.g. harmonic) to avoid having to
			diagonalize massive matrices. This is especially needed for higher dimensionality.
		" this is the way moving forward. "
	[x] cos^2 x gives asymmetric solution
		" solved but not sure how. "

Testing:
	[ ] FDM Eigenvalue solver test-cases
			[x] 1d Harmonic oscillator
			[ ] 2d Harmonic oscillator

			[ ] 2d Harmonic oscillator
			[ ] 3d Harmonic oscillator
			[ ] 1d Particle in a box
			[ ] 2d Particle in a box
			[ ] 3d Particle in a box
	[ ] Timing is not accurate, averaging is wrong

	[x] Separate out and test eigenvalue/-vector solving.
