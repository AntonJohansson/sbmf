SBMF:
	[x] numerical weirdness in results after a certain point?
			[x] whats going on?
				"	the output from lacpake isnt automatically converted to row major in the same way that
					the input is, changed interpretation of eigenvector output to column major. "
			[x] absolute values are still accurate.
				" turns out they weren't accurate, just sneaky, errors in this where especially visible at
					lower grid resolutions. "
	[x] the operator that we're diagonalizing should maybe be real?
		" it should not, we need the output eigenvectors to be complex. "
	[ ] Unify memory allocation


Testing:
	[x] Separate out and test eigenvalue/-vector solving.


Plotting:
	[ ] not freeing vaos/vbos in drawdata
	[ ] Plot 2d planes
	[ ] Handle switching between camera modes
	[ ] Text rendering
			[ ] stb font loading
			[ ] generate fonts
			[ ] draw fonts
			[ ] draw fonts in different colors
	[ ] Togglable plots
