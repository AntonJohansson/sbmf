SBMF (Slightly Beyond Mean Field):
	[x] numerical weirdness in results after a certain point?
			[x] whats going on?
				"	the output from lacpake isnt automatically converted to row major in the same way that
					the input is, changed interpretation of eigenvector output to column major. "
			[x] absolute values are still accurate.
				" turns out they weren't accurate, just sneaky, errors in this where especially visible at
					lower grid resolutions. "
	[x] the operator that we're diagonalizing should maybe be real?
		" it should not, we need the output eigenvectors to be complex. "
	[ ] Try projecting full numerical hamiltonian onto known ground states (e.g. harmonic) to avoid having to
			diagonalize massive matrices. This is especially needed for higher dimensionality.
	[ ] Unify memory allocation.
	[ ] Convert column to row major in eigenvalue solver
	[ ] Many-body pertrubation theory
			[ ] How is this different from regular P.T.?
			[ ] Do I need numerical integration?
	[ ] Potential speedup for ITEM, adaptive timestep
			[ ] See papers/item.pdf
	[ ] cos^2 x gives asymmetric solution
	[ ] particle in a box, maybe rounded corners
	[ ] interest is high in radial and toroidal

Testing:
[x] Separate out and test eigenvalue/-vector solving.


Plotting:
	[ ] Not freeing vaos/vbos in drawdata.

	[ ] Handle switching between camera modes.
	[ ] Text rendering,
			[ ] stb font loading,
			[ ] generate fonts,
			[ ] draw fonts,
			[ ] draw fonts in different colors.
	[ ] Togglable plots.
