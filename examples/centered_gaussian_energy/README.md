# Centered Gaussian -- Energy

Solve the GP equation for a harmonic trap with a centered Gaussian, this is essentially a double well. Before applying perturbation theory the best mean-field is solved and the fractional occupations computed, so we can check the validity of the GP ground state. After this perturbation is applied to calculated energy shifts. All of this is done for multiple particle counts and interaction strengths.

These calculations are done as the GP equation is known to exhibit symmetry breaking. That is the lowest energy state doesn't share the symmetry of the potential. We are interested in whether or not perturbation theory can be used to restore the symmetry of the ground state. To do this we check whether or not we get a lower energy when starting from the unphysical asymmetric state or physical symmetric state.
