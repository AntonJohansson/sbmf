# Centered Gaussian -- Wave function

Solve the GP equation for a harmonic trap with a centered Gaussian, this is essentially a double well. Multiple initial guesses are used, as we expected to see a symmetry breaking for the asymmetric random guess, which is unphysical. The question is whether or not perturbation theory can restore the symmetry of the ground state (this is checked in the "* -- Energy" example). We then save the GP ground state wave functions to output files.
