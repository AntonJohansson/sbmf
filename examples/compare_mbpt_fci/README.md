# Compare MBPT vs FCI

Here we generate output data to allow us to compare our Many Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT) approach against Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) which is only feasible to use for low particle counts. Therefore we study a system of N = 4 particles for various interaction strengths.
