# Compare MBPT vs GP

Here we generate output data to allow us to compare our Many Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT) approach against the GP equation which is only valid for large particle counts and very weak interaction strengths. We therefore start with a system of N = 4 particles and increase N whilst decreasing the interaction strength to see whether or not we converge towards the GP energy.
