# Mixing -- Improving the convergence of the SCF method

For large interaction strengths or more complicated systems with lots of energetically close by states, the SCF method can fail to converge to anything and instead get stuck oscillating between states. To solve this we employ Hamiltonian or orbital mixing. This example outputs data to allow to compare these types of mixing.
