# Self bound states

Here we output data to explore two-component self bound BEC states using perturbation theory. As we are working in the HO basis we use a weak trapping potential (which will interfere with our output energies). This is a system which cannot be described by the regular GP equation. It is then interesting to see how far we can get when starting from it using perturbation theory.
