gaussian guess + dwp + 0.25 self 3 	 other => split ssb
gaussian guess + dwp + 0.25 self 1.5 other => split ssb

gaussian guess  + dwp + 0.25 self 1 other => symmetric groundstate => oscillating 					do oscillating states have lower energy?
symmetric guess + dwp + 0.25 self 1 other => symmetric groundstate

gaussian guess + dwp + 2 self 3 other => oscillating
symmetric guess + dwp + 2 self 3 other => oscillating

oscillating seems to happen when the lowest energy state is symmetric and we start with an asymmetric guess!
